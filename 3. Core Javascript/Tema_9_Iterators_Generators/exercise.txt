Define a function capitalize_last_name() that accepts as argument
a string with a (single) first and a (single) last name, and returns a
string in which only the first letter of the first name is uppercase,
whereas all letters of the last name are uppercase; in otherwords,
'marisa tomei' becomes 'Marisa TOMEI'. (Tip: use str.split() to split
a str into separate words.) If something other than a str object is
passed as an argument, the function should raise a TypeError. (Tip:
you can use isistance() to check whether an object is of a particular
type.) If the str does not consist of exactly two words, the function
should raise a ValueError.
