        <h3>What is DevOps?</h3>
        <p>DevOps (an acronym for development and operations) is a set of practices that brings together software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).<br>
        Its goal is to shorten the software development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery of high-quality software.</p>
        
        <p><strong>DevOps</strong> complements agile software development practices, as many of its principles are derived from Agile methodologies.</p>
        
        <p style="color: red;">The key feature of the DevOps movement is its active advocacy for <strong>automation</strong> and monitoring at every step of the software build process, from integration, testing, deployment, to infrastructure management.</p>
        
        <p>DevOps aims for shorter development cycles, more frequent deployments, and more reliable releases, all closely aligned with business objectives.</p>

        <h3>Why is DevOps Important?</h3>
        <p>DevOps is critical in today’s fast-paced tech environment because it enables faster and more reliable software releases. By automating processes, teams can focus on higher-value tasks, like improving customer experiences and reducing operational risks.</p>
        
        <p>With <strong>continuous integration</strong> and delivery, development teams can catch issues early, ensuring that software updates happen seamlessly without downtime or major disruptions.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, the alignment between development and operations ensures that the software not only works in theory but performs as expected in real-world environments.</p>
